# CVInsight_Project
In todayâ€™s fast-paced hiring landscape, HR teams and recruiters face significant challenges in manually screening and shortlisting resumes. The process is time-consuming, prone to biases, and inefficient, leading to delays in hiring the right candidates.

Our project, Smart Resume Screener, is an AI-powered resume screening system designed to automate and optimize the recruitment process. It will use machine learning and keyword-based filtering to analyze resumes, rank candidates based on job descriptions, and provide a fair and unbiased shortlisting mechanism.

The system will feature resume parsing, automated shortlisting, duplicate detection, bias-free evaluation, ATS integration, and advanced analytics to help recruiters make informed hiring decisions. By reducing manual effort and increasing accuracy, this tool aims to enhance the efficiency and fairness of the recruitment process.
